## Med2Cal - A 2-in-1 prescription scheduler and drug interaction checker

### Description

This Next.js project website is designed to help users generate reminders take their medicine just from their prescirption information, while also finding the interaction between drugs by providing information about the medications they are taking. You can access the website by clicking [here](https://drug-interaction-checker.vercel.app/). To populate the SQL database, I used information from DDinter, an open source repository of drug interaction information.
